Thinkful python class assignment.
from assignment page:

v1: Hard Coded Upper Limit
Hard code in 100 as value for upper limit to count up to when the program runs.
Verify your program works by running it from the command line with python my_script.py, substituting in your Python file name.

v2: User Supplied Inputs
If user supplies value at command line when script runs, we'll use that value.
Otherwise, we'll use the raw_input() dialogue to get an input from the user.
